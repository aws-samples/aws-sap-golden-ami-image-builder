Code covering:

- Enable NFS
- Set clocksource
- Setting /etc/sysctl.d/sap.conf
- Setting timezone

- For OEL specific: Everything from here https://oracle-base.com/articles/19c/oracle-db-19c-installation-on-oracle-linux-8 until "Additional Setup"

while updating tuned. There's two profiles: sap-hana and sap-netweaver. Do we need two different images because of that? Or do we prefer one of them over the other?

TODO: https://oracle-base.com/articles/19c/oracle-db-19c-installation-on-oracle-linux-8 - start from "Additional Setup"
